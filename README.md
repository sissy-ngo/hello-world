# hello-world
This is my first experience with this GitHub and hello-world my first github-repository-project.
##What is an issue
An Issue is a note on a repository about something that needs attention. It could be a bug, a feature request, a question or lots of other things. 
##How To create a branch
Branching is the way to work on different parts of a repository at one time.
##Make a commit
On GitHub, saved changes are called commits. Commits are pretty glorious, because a bunch of them together read like the history of your project.
